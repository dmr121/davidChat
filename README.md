# davidChat
Simple messaging app built with SwiftUI and Firebase as the backend

Requires at least iOS 13.2 to run.

Currently, there is no easy way to pop to the root view in a NavigationView. After logging out, it is recommended that you close the app and reopen. If you log out and don't close the app, it will still work, but the UI will work unpredictably in some places.
